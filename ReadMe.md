> **Your Name Here**

Place your answers for Lab 1 in this repository. **Your code should go in the existing [Lab Submission](LabSubmission.md) markdown file**. The lab specs are in the [PDF document](./Stuff-B-Gone.pdf) that is part of this repository.

> Your lab is to be submitted as a **PDF** generated from a **Markdown** (`*.md`) file. Use the formatting indicated in the legend found in the Lab Submission template. The recommended text editor for these files is [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com), as this editor allows you to preview your markdown document as HTML. ERDs can be created using [Draw.io](https://draw.io) or [**Lucidchart**](https://www.lucidchart.com/) and exported as `*.png` files. Check with your instructor for more details.
